# [EURECOM] Semester Project Text2Code: Can LLMs query a database without SQL?
by Cristian DEGNI, Francesco GIANNUZZO
### Abstract: 
In this study, we investigate the ability of Large Language Models to autonomously generate Python code to query databases, a task we refer to as Text-to-Code. We systematically compare this approach with two established methods: Text-to-SQL} and Table Question Answering, evaluating them across multiple domains, query complexities, and model architectures. To support our analysis, we introduce a dedicated framework for generation, execution and evaluation by ad hoc metrics. While Text-to-Code shows advantages in problems requiring complex reasoning or looser adherence to database structure, Text-to-SQL remains superior for strictly SQL-centric queries.
